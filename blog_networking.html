            <p class="blog">
              Networking is absolutely essential in the creative industries.
              Especially if you are a freelancer. If you have any hope to be
              successful in the industry, people must know of either you
              yourself or your previous work.
            </p>

            <p class="blog_header">So, how do I network?</p>

            <p class="blog">
              With modern social media, it is the easiest it has ever been to
              successfully network. I have personally found success in LinkedIn
              networking. Although, there is different methods and it is up to
              you to find which is more successful for yourself or in which you
              feel more comfortable. I will list some very common methods with a
              brief description below.
            </p>

            <p class="blog_header_2">LinkedIn</p>
            <p class="blog">
              Online social media platform used for business pages and employees
              to communicate and post status updates or available job roles. You
              are able to connect with other users which means you can chat to
              them and see some more information about their profession.
              In-turn, they could also see yours, which could lead to some
              potential freelance opportunities for example.<br /><a
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/"
                class="reference"
                >You can visit the website here.</a
              >
            </p>
            <p class="blog_header_2">Meetups</p>
            <p class="blog">
              In web development, this is a huge networking tool. Meeting other
              developers and potential future work with employers can gain you
              some clients from the meeting alone. It is always important to
              look as professional as possible. This may mean a professional
              dress code, mannerisms and overall portraying yourself in a very
              positive light. Now is time to sell yourself as a business. One
              resource to use is the website Meetup.com.<br /><a
                href="https://www.meetup.com/"
                class="reference"
                >You can visit the website here.</a
              >
            </p>

            <p class="blog_header">What skills do I need?</p>
            <p class="blog">
              To network, not much skill is actually needed. You just need to
              make sure that you have people skills.
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              When chatting with a potential client/employer, it is absolutely
              vital to maintain a professional standpoint and sell yourself.
              This means providing evidence of previous work and discussing your
              skillset. You absolutely must be prepared when attending meetups
              or speaking with one of these people. Somebody who is not prepared
              comes across as lazy and not trustable if they were to hire you
              for your services.
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              You must always remain positive and try your best to answer all of
              your potential client/employer’s questions the best you can. One
              tip I can give is if you do not know the answer to their question,
              answer it with something positive such as
              <span class="italic"
                >“I don’t know, but I could certainly find out for you!”</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              There is thousands of resources out there on the internet for you
              to use to learn how to network. Simply watching YouTube videos on
              the topic gives a massive amount of information and you can teach
              yourself how to network. I will link a video below on a short
              informative video on how to network yourself on the LinkedIn
              platform
            </p>

            <p class="blog_header">What do I gain from networking?</p>

            <p class="blog">
              Depending on your current employment status - whether you are
              full-time or a freelancer, your gains may vary. In web
              development, a freelancer may gain additional clients which in
              turn could earn him more money, plus a new recommendation from a
              new client, plus potential new clients which are gained from the
              initial client’s recommendation.
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              A full-time web developer may end up with a new role which offers
              a higher salary and more learning opportunities. If your name is
              out there, employers will be keeping a close eye on your work so
              it is always important to keep your portfolio up to date.
            </p>

            <p class="blog">
              According to a survey published by Lou Adler, he states that
              <a
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-survey-reveals-85-all-jobs-filled-via-networking-lou-adler/"
                class="reference"
                >"85% of All Jobs are Filled Via Networking"</a
              >. Hopefully, this gives you an insight into how crucial it is to
              network yourself in 2002.
            </p>

            <p class="blog_header">Summary</p>
            <p class="blog">
              As mentioned before, networking has never been easier. Use all of
              the points mentioned in this blog to your advantage and give it a
              go. It will be a slow start most likely, but over time, you will
              gain more and more confidence and earn yourself some new clients.
