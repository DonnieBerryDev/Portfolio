           <p class="blog_header">Does the concept of professionalism apply to the creative industries?</p>
            <p class="blog_header">
                How do you define a Professional?
            </p>
            <p class="blog">In my opinion, I think a professional is an individual who takes pride in what they do. They take pride in their industry, their attire, their attitude and work ethic. When all of these are matched, the individual tends to work harder and achieve better results in their employment. </p>
            <p class="blog">Going more into detail, I like to list these individual areas of professionalism and how they are important. </p>
            <p class="blog_header_2">Work Ethic</p>
            <p class="blog">Having a good work ethic is absolutely vital to the creative industry. Attending employment when needed, being on-call and having a positive attitude when entering the workplace. Being able to separate home life to work life. </p>
            <p class="blog_header_2">Attitude</p>
            <p class="blog">Having a positive attitude is also important. Having a negative attitude will more than surely affect your workflow. People with negative attitudes tend to make more mistakes, disagree more with other colleagues and make the wrong decisions.</p>
            <p class="blog_header_2">Commitment</p>
            <p class="blog">Commitment to your work and your tasks is important in the creative industry. For example, if you are a freelancer, allocating yourself work-hours and sticking to them. Procrastinating is a huge problem in the creative industry as employees tend to run into a sort of “creative block”. It is important to break out of this and continue with your tasks.</p>
            <p class="blog_header_2">Respect</p>
            <p class="blog">Having respect for both your colleagues and your clients is important also. A client will not work with you if you do not respect them and their wishes, as will colleagues. Having respect for your peers ensures that you can both be on the same wavelength and work together easier.</p>
            <p class="blog_header_2">Responsibility</p>
            <p class="blog">Taking responsibility for your actions is the final point I want to make. Everybody can make mistakes and in the creative industry, it is more common than not to make mistakes. People who blame their mistakes on others because they cannot take responsibility makes them more of an amateur. A professional owns up to their mistakes, takes responsibility and works to make sure it doesn’t happen again.</p>

                    How does all this apply to the Web Development Industry? 
                </p>
                <p class="blog">
                    Within this specific industry, it is extremely important to remain professional. You will always be dealing with clients who expect a certain level of professionalism from you. This means simple things such as. 
                </p>
                <ul class="blog">
                    <li>Correct grammar in text correspondence</li>
                    <li>Appropriate attire when meeting physically </li>
                    <li>Setting out contracts with timeframes and budgets </li>
                    <li>Keeping the client in the loop about the work you have been tasked to complete </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="blog">If these 4 points are not followed, you will tend to lose more clients than gain more clients. This can lead to a huge problem within this industry as gaining clients over time is the key to success. </p>
