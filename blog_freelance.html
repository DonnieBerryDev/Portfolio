            <p class="blog_header">Is Freelancing the road to success?</p>
            <p class="blog">
              With the ever-growing list of jobs in the creative industry rising
              by the year, the percentage of people who are sole freelancers is
              also rising. We must ask ourselves the question of: <br /><span
                class="italic large"
                >“Why would people choose freelance over a full-time role with a
                reputable business?”</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              Hopefully in this blog, I can answer that question.
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              There is many advantages and disadvantages to going down the
              freelance route and these vary from person to person. For some
              people, a full-time role may be more suitable. I will list below
              the advantages and disadvantages of going down the freelance route
              but I will be making references to my industry which is the web
              development industry, but the points still apply to the creative
              industry as a whole.
            </p>
            <p class="blog_header_2">Advantages</p>

            <p class="blog_header_3">Be your own boss</p>
            <p class="blog">
              By being self-employed, you will oversee all of your affairs and
              only you (unless you hire additional staff such as a finance
              manager)
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              For a lot of people, this can be an advantage as it gives a sense
              of consistency and not being tied town to specific timetables,
              giving you the sense of freedom.
            </p>

            <p class="blog_header_3">The Pay</p>
            <p class="blog">
              Since you will not be working with a large business/small agency,
              you can retain 100% of the profits from the work you are given by
              your clients. This is a large reason that most people go
              freelance. Although, since you will be working solo, you will have
              to manage your time correctly to make sure you are not taking on
              too much work at once, which in turn will slow down your entire
              workflow.
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              Being freelance is the number one way to make more money in the
              web development industry as you can make way above the salaried
              amount for most roles
            </p>

            <p class="blog_header_3">The Ability to choose what you work on</p>
            <p class="blog">
              You will be able to decide for yourself which projects to take on.
              If something serves no benefit to you either financially or
              education wise, maybe it is not wise to take on and you are under
              no obligation to undertake the work. With a full-time role, you
              may not have much say in the matter.
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              If you are given a very long and tedious website to build that you
              won’t gain much from, you can simply decline and maybe recommend a
              developer who would be better suited.
            </p>

            <p class="blog_header_2">Disadvantages</p>
            <p class="blog_header_3">Not paid on time</p>
            <p class="blog">
              A large problem with freelancing is because you are in charge of
              your own affairs, it is up to you to discuss with the client
              payment times. If you are dealing with an agency or a larger
              business, you may experience extended wait times in getting paid
              for your work.<a
                href="https://www.bill.com/about-us/press-release/billcom-survey-reveals-gig-economy-workers-prefer-clients-use-digital/"
                class="reference"
              >
                According to a survey from bill.com, 54% of freelancers in the
                UK admit that they do not get paid on time.</a
              >
            </p>
            <div class="blog_img">
              <img
                src="assets/img/paidtime.png"
                alt="Freelance study on time it takes to get paid"
              />
            </div>

            <p class="blog_header_3">Filing your own tax</p>
            <p class="blog">
              You will have to file your own tax returns instead of it
              automatically being deducted from a monthly salary. Many
              freelancers opt to hire a finance manager to take care of this for
              them.
            </p>

            <p class="blog_header_3">No full-time benefits</p>
            <p class="blog">
              A very large reason that people stick with full-time roles is the
              benefits. Things such as a guaranteed income at the end of the
              month, holiday pay, sick-pay, employee benefits etc. Losing these
              benefits could be catastrophic for some people so you need to make
              sure that you are willing to lose these benefits and adjust
              accordingly.
            </p>

            <p class="blog_header_3">Initially gaining clients</p>
            <p class="blog">
              You absolutely must network yourself to be successful as a
              freelancer. How will anybody know you are available if you don’t
              have an online presence? Things such as setting up a LinkedIn
              profile, attending meetups, gaining recommendations from previous
              clients. These things can help you gain more clients and gain a
              solid clientele list.

              How to be a successful Freelance Web Developer
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              I have touched on a few topics during this blog that answer this
              question. Things such as networking yourself and recommending
              different developers to complete tasks for a client instead of
              yourself. The main thing you should focus on is gaining a great
              reputation for yourself.
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              <span class="italic"
                >“How can I gain a reputation for myself?”</span
              >
              you may ask. The main key is
              <span class="bold">consistency in your work.</span> Make sure your
              work is always up to the clients standard and be a great
              point-of-contact. This means replying to emails swiftly and do not
              take a long time to respond. Keep in touch with your client, let
              them know what stage you are at in the work and what the estimated
              time is remaining in the project if possible.
            </p>
            <p class="blog">
              After you have completed the work for the client and the client is
              satisfied, it is always important to gain feedback. Get a
              recommendation from the client and ask them (if appropriate) to
              tell a colleague or friend about your services. This will gain you
              clients over time and be known as a reputable freelance developer.
