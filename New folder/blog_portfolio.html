                    <p class="blog">In today’s job market, a portfolio is a good and essential way to showcase your skills and abilities to make yourself stand out from the rest of the crowd. Shining light on yourself as an applicant will improve your chances of gaining further employment.</p>
                    <p class="blog">When you are creating your portfolio, it is important to take your job industry into consideration. If you are a web designer, it is important to create a very well-designed website to showcase your skills as a designer. If you are a front-end web developer, it is important to showcase your coding abilities on the site itself etc. Having a PDF of your normal CV slapped onto a website is not good practice, make yourself stand out! </p>

                    <p class="blog">I have listed a video from the content creator “Flux”. The video details the differences between a portfolio which needs improvement and one which stands out from the crowd. It is important to watch this type of content to build an understanding of what you need to list in your own personal portfolio and what types of content to avoid. </p>

                    <p class="blog">I will link you to a article by author Denis Kryukov which goes further into detail about what makes a great web development CV in 2020. There is a mountain of tips and should answer all of your questions. <a href="https://soshace.com/web-developer-portfolio-the-definitive-2019-guide-with-15-portfolio-examples/" class="reference">Web Developer Portfolio: The Definitive 2019 Guide with 15 Portfolio Examples</a></p>

                    <p class="blog_header">My Personal Portfolio</p>
                    <p class="blog">I have posted a picture of my own personal WIP portfolio website. I feel this is a perfect design for me since it is: </p>
                    <ul class="blog">
                        <li>Easy to read</li>
                        <li>Straight to the point </li>
                        <li>Lists my skills without too much unnecessary information </li>
                        <li>A call-to-action button to download my CV at first glance. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="blog">
                        As you can see, by hovering over the icons for each specific skill, a tool tip is presented to name the skill for any passing user who is confused by what the logo means. Having text itself would be satisfactory, however, I think this design choice matches my portfolio better.
                    </p>

                    <p class="blog">
                        Keeping your portfolio up to date should be your number one priority and it should serve as a sort of “hub” area for all of your past and present work. This can range from WIP projects, past client work and areas you are currently studying. It should be informative but not too clumpy. Employers are very interested in what you are currently learning and/or have learned.
                    </p>
                    <div class="blog_img">
                        <img src="assets/img/portfolio.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p class="blog_header">
                        Contact
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog">
                        Finally, you should include a contact area. How else could somebody tell you how interested they are in your work?
                    </p>

                    <p class="blog">
                        This could be a google form, a contact number, an email to use etc. You need some form of contact on your portfolio to make it have any use. I personally list my hometown, my email address and my mobile number. This way, your potential employer has multiple methods to reach you.
                    </p>

                    <p class="blog">
                        In conclusion, it is essential to have a portfolio in todays market to showcase your current skills, what you are looking to do. A portfolio built over time will grow and grow and make you stand out even further from your competition in the job market.
