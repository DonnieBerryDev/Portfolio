           <p class="blog_header">IP stands for <span class="italic">“Intellectual Property”</span>. So what exactly is it?</p>
           <p class="blog">As quoted from <a href="www.wipo.int">www.wipo.int</a>, <span class="italic">“Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.”</span></p>
           <div class="blog_img">
               <img src="assets/img/iprights.png" alt="IP Rights Types">
               <p class="img_src">Source: <a href="https://www.elizabethpottsweinstein.com/5-types-of-intellectual-property/">elizabethpottsweinstein.com</a></p>
           </div>
           
           <p class="blog">Examples of IP could be a company logo with a specific design. A company name or an image that was taken by a specific person. It is a form of protection for you or your businesses content.</p>
           
           <p class="blog">You can register for different types of protection for your own intellectual property such as trademarks, patents or registered designs. Ways to apply for this vary from place to place so it is always best to do your own research on the best way to do this.</p>
           
           <p class="blog_header">
               How does IP affect the creative industry?
           </p>
           
           <p class="blog">
               I will speak about my industry since I have experience. In the web development industry, understanding intellectual property is extremely important. I must make sure that I am not using things such as copyrighted images, when I am designing a logo – not copying another businesses logo design. Small things like this cannot be overlooked.
           </p>
           
           <p class="blog">In the creative industry, it is extremely important to understand intellectual property and understand when a piece of material can and cannot be used. If it cannot be used, it is important to gain the authorization from the original owner of the material to use it in your project.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="blog">The whole purpose of the creative industry is to be creative. You must make sure in whatever project you are working on, that you are using either original material, material made by another author but given authorization to you, or finally, paid for content. If this advice is not followed, you are opening yourself up to many problems such as civil charges or in extreme cases, jail time.</p>
        
        <p class="blog_header">Where can I get some material?</p>
        <p class="blog">There are multiple resources that you can take advantage of. Some are paid for, some are free. I will list some below that will help you, especially in the web development industry.</p>
        
        <p class="blog_header_2">Pexels </p>
        <p class="blog">This is my favourite source for copyright-free images. You can search for specific kinds of images and pick one to your taste and with very high quality, completely copyright free</p>
        <p class="blog_header_2">Adobe Stock</p>
        <p class="blog">This is a paid for service by Adobe. By paying a monthly subscription, you open yourself up to Adobe’s endless list of stock images for you to take advantage of. You can even sign up for a free trial of 10 images to give it a try before you buy.</p>
        <p class="blog_header_2">Reddit list of websites</p>
        <p class="blog"> By clicking the link <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/8ssk1i/repost_ultimate_collection_of_free_stock_photos/">here</a>, you will find a very large list of free stock photo and video websites for you to take advantage of. Some may be outdated though but make sure to find one that works for you.</p>
        
        <p class="blog_header">Summary</p>
        <p class="blog">Intellectual property in the creative industries is one of the most important points to understand. You absolutely must make sure that you are never using copyrighted material without permission and must follow the steps to gain permission if it is needed.</p>
        
        <p class="blog">Also, make sure to always trademark your work to avoid anybody else stealing your content. If your content is not protected and it is stolen, you will not have much of a legal standpoint to fight it.</p>
